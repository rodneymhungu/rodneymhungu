## Introduction

Last year, I started sending a quarterly internal data security report on behalf of the Netherlands solution engineering team for data security. It proved helpful for spreading messages on key focus areas in the data security space, but I’ve realized these reports belong outside Microsoft as well.

Compared to any previous year, customer asks around data security have exploded, driven of course by the rise of AI. Legendary [financial analyst Mary Meeker](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/venture-capitalist-mary-meeker-revives-her-trend-reports-with-a-deep-dive-into-the-ai-boom/) captured this in her [May 2025 report on AI](https://www.bondcap.com/report/pdf/Trends_Artificial_Intelligence.pdf), where she used the word *unprecedented* more than 50 times. One striking use of the word to me was her coverage on mass tech adoption cycles: in the US each major technology wave - PCs, desktops, mobile, now AI - reached 50% household adoption in half the time of the previous wave. This time AI household adoption is projected to take as short as 3 years, which is sure to disrupt every (big) company’s [long term planning](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/enduring-ideas-the-three-horizons-of-growth?) efforts. It’s no wonder why our customers and partners want more frequent, high-quality broad-based insights to keep up. Perhaps I can add value as a curator.

For the first time, I’ll publish this kind of report publicly before resharing internally. Just as DJs became cultural curators during the digital music explosion, I see newsletters and reports playing a similar role in today’s content explosion, hopefully helping you dodge a lot of [AI slop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_slop) along the way

## Security for AI: Microsoft’s Focus Areas

In the Netherlands, we recently delivered several [Innovation Hub](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hub) sessions with financial services customers to map out secure AI deployment strategies. These sessions target the [*Frontier Firms*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/2025-the-year-the-frontier-firm-is-born) of tomorrow: organizations that can harness intelligence on tap to keep pace with business demands moving faster than human capacity.

The feedback was great. Here’s the PowerPoint material so you can jumpstart your own journey.

### Overview: [*Security for AI – Intro – Sept 2025.pptx*](https://livesend.microsoft.com/i/uwLJ79rAy78nna5Hl04H0Q2gQImGllYr9nDweI9sUrsQaGmlyQv4IZxpVnXhRkqGr0g4qyqgkWPtiK52V___lg1UAJ1i142dOlWz4LN8tvDbZVtGLEoutvYRl5lkW11AY7)      

* **What it covers**: Why agentic AI changes the threat landscape; risks across data, identity, threats, and regulations; Microsoft’s Zero Trust for AI approach.
    
* **Framework**: Prepare → Discover → Protect → Govern.
    
* **Why it matters**: Provides executives and technical teams with a shared mental model before diving into details.
    

1. ### Data Leakage & Inaccuracy: [*Security for AI 1 – Data Leakage and Inaccuracy – Sept 2025.pptx*](https://livesend.microsoft.com/i/uwLJ79rAy78nna5Hl04H0Q2gQImGllYr9nDweI9sUrvuVSmFVPvcePsSpDLn7wOMu1nTx3EEzE5JUKOiEdYWmMRNn8p2Z2Hl6jO7RhABp2rfGLEaFDploRrcYT4QAjzo)
    

* **What it covers**: Guardrails to prevent sensitive data loss and improve AI output quality. Covers access cleanup, sensitivity labels, DLP, AI usage discovery, and runtime checks.
    
* **Why it matters**: Provides concrete steps you can implement quickly to reduce [oversharing](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/mitigate-oversharing-to-govern-microsoft-365-copilot-and-agents/4448744), prevent exfiltration, and curb hallucinations.
    

2. ### Emerging Threats & Vulnerabilities: [*Security for AI 2 – Emerging AI threats and vulnerabilities – Sept 2025.pptx*](https://livesend.microsoft.com/i/uwLJ79rAy78nna5Hl04H0Q2gQImGllYr9nDweI9sUruMhOSbMoOecZ8___w4bCrjIAQnPLUSSIGNgT8SZABwcnT40fMTTkPLUSSIGNTD7W4DdnQseV6xsCZQUlqdhqo26___ZLZVtWLiS47n18)
    

* **What it covers**: New attack vectors (prompt injection, model theft, data poisoning, plugin flaws). Demonstrates AI red teaming, posture management, and runtime protections.
    
* **Why it matters**: Gives security architects and SOC leads actionable monitoring and incident response strategies.
    

3. ### Agent Sprawl & Risks: [*Security for AI 3 – Agent sprawl and risks – Sept 2025.pptx*](https://livesend.microsoft.com/i/uwLJ79rAy78nna5Hl04H0Q2gQImGllYr9nDweI9sUrvBbAqF4v9XTkB96tty7KJuTU85hQQI74CPLUSSIGNeXlOtkRfmzAbzT6JYiHgbbBB4lttH3inUkpsTFSvDzWKJf2___qS9N)
    

* **What it covers**: How to manage the explosion of AI agents. [Entra Agent ID](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/announcing-microsoft-entra-agent-id-secure-and-manage-your-ai-agents/3827392)s, least-privilege access, and monitoring of agent behaviors.
    
* **Why it matters**: Prevents “shadow agents,” compliance gaps, and risky automation—treating agents like digital employees with proper identity and access controls.
    

4. ### Compliance: [*Security for AI 4 – Compliance – Sept 2025.pptx*](https://livesend.microsoft.com/i/uwLJ79rAy78nna5Hl04H0Q2gQImGllYr9nDweI9sUrs1ycrW6FhM7Z6bjZJC9GQVKPLUSSIGNwmFk6EgqnRYGPLUSSIGNbCvYuxTlfobfr5YXX1tTzfXnCaCLfSEPQICilSxJwOeXav90d)
    

* **What it covers**: Aligning AI use with regulations like the EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 42001, and NIST AI RMF. Shows how Microsoft Purview, Defender, and other tools provide audit-ready evidence.
    

* **Why it matters**: Translates policy into proof, helping organizations stay compliant without stalling innovation.

**Tell me what you think!** At Microsoft we focus heavily on execution, but without customer and partner input, execution can easily become just a collection of hammers looking for nails. Your feedback ensures these resources truly address real-world business problems.
